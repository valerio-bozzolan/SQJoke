# SQJoke
***SQJoke*** (aka _**Superquark** Joke_) refers to the omonimous well-known italian TV programme about cultural divulgation.

It reproduces the solemn [Orchestral suites of Johann Sebastian Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestral_suites_%28Bach%29|Orchestral suites of Johann Sebastian Bach), which introduces this TV programme.

### AYFKM? What it does?
As already said, this stupid app simply reproduce that song.

## Usage
The right question is *when* to use this app:

* When arrives that prolix friend that shoots bullshit but you are more stupid than him and you have to prove it speaking over him with this soundtrack
* If you are [Piero Angela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piero_Angela), [Alberto Angela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_Angela) or you want to appear cool like them
* To solemnify that absolutely crucial speech
Other uses of this app are unknown, but it's absolutelly necessary when you're reading "fuffa-documents" a.k.a SalvatoreAranzulla-like unuseful posts ([example](https://whilefalsedonothing.wordpress.com/2016/04/24/accurata-descrizione-delle-guide-informatiche-scritte-da-incompetenti/)).

Sorry if some of these examples can't be explained to non-italian people.
